# Timeseries Forecasting

### Goal
â€¢	In this project I tried to predict December 2019 sales using the historical daily sales data (From January 2017 to December 2019).  
 
### Description
* There are two separate script files, one for the ARMA model (Autoregressive - moving average) and the other for the various machine learning algorithms. 

* I seperated them since they have different processing steps.

### Workflow

    * Dataset is pre-processed, handled missing values
    * For the ARIMA model, to check stationarity, Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied.
    * Autocorrelation/Partial autocorrelation plots are created and parameters of (p,d,q) are determined wrt to them
    
    * For the machine learning models, since there are no features, I created 6 new features from the time stamps.
      o A feature for year
      o	A feature for month of year 
      o	A feature for week of the year
      o	A feature for day of the month
      o	A feature for day of the week
      o	A feature for whether it is weekend or not

    * Tried various machine learning models and decided to use Random Forest model based on the RMSE score of them.
    * Then I trained the model again but this time with the whole dataset (to predict the December sales)


### Libraries Used
*	numpy, pandas
*	sklearn
* statsmodel
